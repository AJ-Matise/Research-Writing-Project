            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Sneaker reselling involves buying limited-edition sneakers and selling them at higher prices once they're sold out. I began reselling in high school and eventually built a company that helped other resellers succeed in this market.

            <h2>The Sneaker Reselling Boom</h2>
            <p>
                The sneaker industry is a perfect example of a fad market that rapidly grew and then contracted. During its growth, many entrepreneurs entered the market, providing valuable services and products to meet the increasing demand.

            <h2>COVID-19 and Market Shifts</h2>
            <p>
                During the COVID-19 pandemic, the sneaker reselling market exploded. Lockdowns and stimulus checks meant people had more time and disposable income, leading to higher demand for sneakers. This attracted more resellers and entrepreneurs into the industry.

            <h2>Lessons for Entrepreneurs</h2>
            <p>
                As the pandemic subsided, demand decreased. People returned to normal life, and many resellers and companies exited the market due to lower profits. This shows the importance of recognizing when a market is contracting.
            </p>

            <h2>The Importance of Focusing on Expanding Markets</h2>
            <p>
                Entrepreneurs should focus on growing markets with untapped potential. By entering expanding markets, they can create more value for customers and themselves, maximizing economic impact.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Realizing that the sneaker reselling market is contracting, I plan to move on to new opportunities, like the artificial intelligence industry. It's crucial for entrepreneurs to direct their efforts toward markets where innovation and services are needed.
